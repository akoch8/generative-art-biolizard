# Generative art

Two generative art experiments for the 2023 BioLizard generative art competition.

## 1. No, you're a flow cell

Genome and RNA sequencing often rely on high-throughout sequencing "flow cells", which is essentially a chip filled with nucleotide probes at distinct spots. Sequencing happens one nucleotide at a time and when included in the growing sequence, each nucleotide emits a specific color that then is detected by a sensitive camera. This results in the typical colorful sequencing flow cell images full of colored dots. And now you can be a flow cell too! Simply open the index.html file in your browser and allow access to your webcam. The webcam feed is then transformed into a dynamic flow cell image. Of you! 📸 ✨

## 2. CompARTative genomics

This was an attempt to generate some semi-randomised visualisations of genome sequence comparisons. My idea was to _somehow_ be able to show a greater similarity in sequence between humans 🤸‍♂️ and bonobos 🐒 than between humans 🤸‍♂️ and lizards 🦎 . It didn't really work out that way, but I also did not spend a lot of time on it to be honest. For example, the tool now just takes some random sequence at the start of chromosome 1. It would probably be a better idea to look at known conserved region.
